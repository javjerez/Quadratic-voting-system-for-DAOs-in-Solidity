# üó≥Ô∏è Quadratic Voting Smart Contract for DAOs

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that implements a **quadratic voting system for DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)**. The contract allows participants to register, propose initiatives, vote using quadratic weighting, and execute approved proposals ‚Äî all **on-chain**.

> üìù The complete design rationale and analysis are detailed in the project's technical report (Spanish only): `Memoria Proyecto.pdf`.

## üìå Features

- **Quadratic Voting**: Vote costs grow quadratically (1, 4, 9, ...).
- **Two Proposal Types**:
  - Funding proposals with a budget.
  - Signaling proposals (no budget, non-binding).
- **Dynamic Threshold Approval**: Proposals are approved once a calculated threshold is met.
- **ERC20 Token Integration**: Users vote using a dedicated ERC20 token created during deployment.
- **Gas-efficient architecture**: Avoids loops in critical functions using ‚Äúpull over push‚Äù pattern.
- **Secure and modular**:
  - Proposal execution through interfaces.
  - Uses OpenZeppelin standards.
  - Protection against common vulnerabilities.

## üîê Security Measures

| Vulnerability                | Mitigation                                                                 | Code Reference                                       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Overflow/Underflow**      | Solidity ^0.8.0 prevents them by default                                   | All arithmetic operations                            |
| **Unchecked Arithmetic**    | Used only where overflow is realistically impossible                       | `nProposals`, `nParticipants`, `withdrawFromProposal()` |
| **Reentrancy**              | Guarded using `lock` modifier                                              | `stake()`, `withdrawFromProposal()`, `executeSignaling()` |
| **DelegateCall Attack**     | No delegateCall used. Owner is set via constructor                         | Constructor                                          |
| **tx.origin misuse**        | Only uses `msg.sender` for access control                                  | All modifiers                                        |
| **Block Timestamp Abuse**   | Contract logic does not rely on block timestamps                           | ‚Äî                                                    |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)** | Avoided using "pull over push" design in `closeVoting()`                   | `executeSignaling()`, memory design                  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation & Deployment

### Requirements

- Node.js with Hardhat
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- OpenZeppelin contracts

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @openzeppelin/contracts
Compile
bash
Copiar
Editar
npx hardhat compile
Deploy Example
js
Copiar
Editar
const QuadraticVoting = await ethers.getContractFactory("QuadraticVoting");
const contract = await QuadraticVoting.deploy(tokenPrice, maxTokens);
üß™ Usage Example
Open voting (only owner):

solidity
Copiar
Editar
contract.openVoting({ value: 8000 });
Add participant and buy tokens:

solidity
Copiar
Editar
contract.addParticipant({ value: 500 });
Create proposals:

solidity
Copiar
Editar
contract.addProposal("Title", "Description", 2000, addressOfProposalContract);
Vote (stake):

solidity
Copiar
Editar
contract.stake(2, proposalId); // Uses 4 tokens
Withdraw votes:

solidity
Copiar
Editar
contract.withdrawFromProposal(1, proposalId); // Gets 1 token back
Execute signaling:

solidity
Copiar
Editar
contract.executeSignaling(proposalId);
